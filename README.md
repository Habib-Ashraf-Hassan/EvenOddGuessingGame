# EvenOddGuessingGame

A game of player Vs computer which has two parts:
- ## Deciding part
Decide who gets to be the bat or ball(derived from cricket game)

player chooses EVEN or ODD and if player chose EVEN then computer will be the opposite and vice versa

Then player picks number between 1-6 amd computer also picks number(randomly), then if total is an EVEN number then one who chose EVEN gets to start to be the bat else one who chose ODD becomes the bat

- ## Guessing opponets choice
bat would be the one choosing a number and ball would be the one guessing if ball fails to guess correct number chose by bat then the bat gets points equivalent to number he chose and this continues until bat's chosen number is equal to ball's guessed number

Then the role are swapped (i.e between player and computer)

the one with most number of points at the end, wins
